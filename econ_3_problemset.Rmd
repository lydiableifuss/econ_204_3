#2. Based on this regression, what can you say about the value of a single prevented whale death? (Hint: Think about how risk reduction for all whales translates into the number of whale deaths avoided)

#Hints
#Solve for bid
#Risk Reduction (20%), 5 whales saved, this is a constant 

#1. Rearranged equation in terms of bid ~ other variables
#2. Multipled each calculated coefficient by 0.04 (20% / 5 whales = 4% or 0.04)
#3. Total value in terms of dollars for mitigating death of one whale = $69.39
