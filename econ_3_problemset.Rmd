#1. Create a linear probability model that predicts a respondent’s probability of voting ‘yes’ on the ballot based on their age, income, NEP score, the risk reduction offered by the program, and the cost of the program to that respondent. Show the model and interpret the regression coefficients.

#create regression model:

#risk 
#bid (annual payment for household, WTP/cost of program to the respondant)
#vote (0 or 1, no or yes)
#NEP (measure of environmental concern)
#income
#age

 
# A. Saturated model: contains all predictor variables

#2. Based on this regression, what can you say about the value of a single prevented whale death? (Hint: Think about how risk reduction for all whales translates into the number of whale deaths avoided)

#Hints
#Solve for bid
#Risk Reduction (20%), 5 whales saved, this is a constant 

#1. Rearranged equation in terms of bid ~ other variables
#2. Multipled each calculated coefficient by 0.04 (20% / 5 whales = 4% or 0.04), determine WTP for vessel speed reduction programs from 0 - 4% 
#3. Total value to mitigate death of one whale = $2.7834
