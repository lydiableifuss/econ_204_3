#PART 1##########

#create regression model:

#risk 
#bid (annual payment for household, WTP/cost of program to the respondant)
#vote (0 or 1, no or yes)
#NEP (measure of environmental concern)
#income
#age

 
# A. Saturated model: contains all predictor variables 
whale_lm1 <- lm(vote ~ risk + bid + NEP + income + age , data = whale_data)
whale_lm1

#Interperet Regression Coefficients (google doc)
#Income: Middle
#Age: over sixty 
```

```{r}
#2. Based on this regression, what can you say about the value of a single prevented whale death? (Hint: Think about how risk reduction for all whales translates into the number of whale deaths avoided)

#Hints
#Solve for bid
#Risk Reduction (20%), 5 whales saved, this is a constant 

whale_lm2 <- lm(bid ~ risk + vote + NEP + income + age , data = whale_data)
whale_lm2
